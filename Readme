== What is it?

Sass Base is a small collection of CSS mixins using SASS picked best parts 
from Yahoo YUI CSS and Blueprint CSS. I'll try to keep Sass Base as minimum
as possible. Use it and fork it as you wish, merge requests are always welcome!

== How it is useful?

First, Sass mixins rock! 
It lets you do grid similar to Blueprint but with semantic way:

.content
  +column(600px)

.sidebar
  +last-column(300px)

Sass mixins gives you very nice maintainable sass files, only minus is that
css file will become a bit longer.

You can use virtual px for font size:

.header
  font-size = !18px
  
It will be converted to 123.1% based on YUI Font CSS calculation (its recalculated), 
read more at http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ about it.


== How to install?

First istall haml gem (version 2.0.3 or newer):

  sudo gem istall haml

Second add config.gem 'haml' to your rails config/environment.rb:

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    config.gem 'haml'
  end
  
Third add base.sass to your public/stylesheets/sass/ directory and 
add import at the top of your application.sass:

  @import base.sass
