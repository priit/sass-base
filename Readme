== What is it?

Sass Base is a small collection of CSS mixins using SASS picked best parts 
from Yahoo YUI CSS and Blueprint CSS. I'll try to keep Sass Base as minimum
as possible. Use it and fork it as you wish, merge requests are always welcome!

== How it is useful?

First, Sass mixins rock! 
It lets you do grid similar to Blueprint but with semantic way:

.content
  +column(600px)

.sidebar
  +last-column(300px)

Sass mixins gives you very nice maintainable sass files, only minus is that
css file will become a bit longer.

You can use virtual px for font size:

.header
  font-size = !18px
  
It will be converted to 123.1% based on YUI Font CSS calculation,

== How to install?

Install Chris Eppstein fork of haml, that allows you to store sass files in more 
than one directory and use mixins with variable:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/chriseppstein/haml.git

== Credits

Reset, Font, Base is from Yahoo YUI CSS framework (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)

Thanks goes to Chris Eppstein for promoting Sass mixins!
