== What is it?

Sass Base is a small collection of CSS mixins using SASS picked best parts 
from Yahoo YUI CSS and Blueprint CSS. I'll try to keep Sass Base as minimum
as possible. Use it and fork it as you wish, merge requests are always welcome!



== How to install?

Firstly istall haml gem (version 2.0.3 or newer):

  sudo gem istall haml

Add config.gem 'haml' to your rails config/environment.rb:

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    config.gem 'haml'
  end
  
Secondly install Sass Base

  git clone git://gitorious.org/sass-base/mainline.git
  or git clone git://github.com/priit/sass-base.git

Add base.sass to your public/stylesheets/sass/ directory and 
add @import at the top of your application.sass:

  @import base.sass



== How it is useful?

First, Sass and its mixins rock! 
It lets you do grid similar to Blueprint but with very nice semantic way:

.content
  +column(600px)       # => usual column

.sidebar
  +column(300px,last)  # => last column in the row

#Footer
  +column              # => now it uses maximum !containerWidth value (default is 975px)


You can use virtual px for font size:

.header
  font-size = !18px
  
It will be converted to 138.4615% what is inspired from YUI Font CSS calculation (its recalculated), 
read more at http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ about it.



== Examples

You can take a look how Sass Base is used at some projects:

Reset, Font, Base is from Yahoo YUI CSS framework (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)
Grid is inspired from Bluepirnt CSS (http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/)
Thanks goes to Chris Eppstein for promoting Sass mixins!
