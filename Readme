== What is Sass Base?

Sass Base is a small collection of CSS mixins using Sass and Compass. 

I have picked parts from Yahoo YUI and improved Blueprint Grid.
Use it and fork it as you wish, merge requests are always welcome!


== How to install?

First, please install Compass and Haml/Sass form:
  
  http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass/getting-started

Now you can clone Sass Base:

  git clone git://gitorious.org/sass-base/mainline.git

and copy base.sass to rails_root/app/stylesheets/ directory.
add add import to your screen.sass:

  @import base.sass


== How it is useful?

First, Sass and its mixins rock! 
Sass Base lets you do grid similar to Blueprint but with very nice semantic way:

.content
  +column(600px)       # => usual column

.sidebar
  +column(300px,last)  # => last column in the row

#Footer
  +column              # => now it uses maximum !containerWidth value (default is 975px)

From Compass about how to use Yahoo YUI font size:
  Sets the font size specified in pixels using percents so that the base
  font size changes and 1em has the correct value. When nesting font size
  declarations, within the DOM tree, the base_font_size must be the parent's
  effective font-size in pixels.
  Usage Examples:
   .big
     +font-size(16px)
   .bigger
     +font-size(18px)
   .big .bigger
     +font-size(18px, 16px)
